element.dataset.userId is accessing a custom data attribute from the HTML element. 

Here's how it works:

In the HTML, you have data-user-id="123". This is a custom data attribute (any attribute starting with data-)
When you access it via JavaScript's dataset property:

The data- prefix is removed
The hyphenated name is converted to camelCase
So data-user-id becomes userId in the dataset
